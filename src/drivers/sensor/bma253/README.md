# BMA2 Sensor API

### Sensor overview

The BMA2 is a triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital output. An ASIC in the sensor converts the output of a 
micromechanical acceleration-sensing structure that works according to the differential capacitance principle. The 
sensor senses tilt, motion, inactivity and shock vibration in cell phones, handhelds, computer peripherals, man-machine 
interfaces, virtual reality features and game controllers.

### Target Application
- Display profile switching
- Menu scrolling, tap / double tap sensing
- Gaming
- Pedometer / step counting
- Free-fall detection
- E-compass tilt compensation
- Drop detection for warranty logging
- Advanced system power management for mobile applications

### Feature
- Accelerometer 
- Temperature
